# Image Recognition Project in C++
## Project Overview
- This C++ project leverages OpenCV, GLFW, and IMGUI to implement various image recognition features. The project includes the following functionalities:

1. Face Detection
2. Eyes Detection
3. Image Capture
4. Face Recognition
5. Facial Emotion Detection (Additional)

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

1. **C++ Compiler: MinGW**
    - Add the MinGW bin directory to the system's environment variables (e.g., C:\MinGW\bin).
    - MINGW: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

2. **Install or Extract OpenCV to the C:\ directory.**
    -Add the OpenCV bin directory to the system's environment variables (e.g., C:\opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin).
    - CMake: https://cmake.org/download/

3. **Install CMake to generate build files.**
    - GLFW: https://www.glfw.org/
    - GLFW is used for window creation.

4. **IMGUI GitHub:** https://github.com/ocornut/imgui

## Setting Up the Project

1. Configure C++ Compiler:
    - Install MinGW and add its bin directory to the system's PATH.

2. Configure OpenCV:
    - Install or extract OpenCV to the C:\ directory.
    - Add the OpenCV bin directory to the system's PATH.

3. Download CMake and CMakeLists Extension for VSCode:
    - Install CMake and the CMake extension in Visual Studio Code for easy project configuration.

## Building and Running the Project
    - Build the Project: Use CMake to generate build files.
